Welcome to my personal homepage.<br>
I'm Zuo Xudong, a first year Ph.D. student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn) (USTC). My research interest lies in AI driven Industrial Intelligence, with a focus on bridging the gap between advanced algorithms and their practical applications in solving real-world industrial challenges.<br>
I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Yunbo Zhao](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/ybzhao) at the [Networked Intelligent Control Lab](https://www.niclab.ac.cn) (NIC Lab).My doctoral research is conducted in close collaboration with the China Railway Group Limited (CREC).<br>
Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [HeFei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn) (HFUTï¼‰. Beyond my primary research on TBMs, my broader interests include machine learning, control theory, and data-driven modeling for complex industrial systems.<br>
I am always open to discussing new ideas and potential collaborations. You can find my CV for more details: [Zuo Xudong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae_zxd.pdf).
